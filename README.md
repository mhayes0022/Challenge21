# MERN Book Search Engine

## Page Description

This application is a book search engine. The main page displays a search bar at the middle center that allows you to enter titles of books. The top right corner of the display has links reading 'Search For Books', 'See Your Books', and 'Login/Sign Up'. If you are already logged in, this button in the top right will be replaced with one reading 'Logout'. When you search for a book title in the search bar, you are shown multiple results which include an image of the book cover and additional information about them. At the bottom of the informational section for each book, a button appears allowing you to 'Save This Book!'. If you click the 'Save This Book!' button below a search result while you are logged in, it saves the book result to your user account. If you are logged out, it prompts you to login or signup. When you click the 'See Your Books' button at the top right while signed in, you will see all of the book results you have saved to your account. Each saved result will have a 'Delete Book' button associated with it, to allow you to remove it from your list of saved books.

## Credits

This application is primarily composed of code provided by the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp Program. I modified many of the files and added several in order to convert the application from using a RESTful API to a GraphQL API. While I did much of this conversion on my own, I did recieve very helpful feedback from a tutor working through the University.
